# Code-Style-Checker
Write a program that takes as an argument a .cpp file and performs code style checking. The program should check if the .cpp file meets the following rules: the variable names consist of more than one letter the variable and function names should be based on snake_case style, it means that a function named CreateFile() will be considered as wrong, as it shouldâ€™ve been named create_file(). The rule applies to both functions and variables. if cout, cin, endl, string and vector are used in a code they shoud start with std:: The program should tell the user the about the wrong style as soon as it is detected
